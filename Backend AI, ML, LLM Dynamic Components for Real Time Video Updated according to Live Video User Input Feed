//This is a dynamic and extendable application to run on people's desktops with Video generated by AI, ideally in real time.  If real time video AI generation is not feasible, we will build this model to support the generation of video in response to user input. Such UX will feature a live video recorded by the user.  The backend server will process the information (audio and video) uploaded by the user.  Then, the backend server will generate the parameters for a video output description (video and audio).  After that, the backend server will request via API to generate a video and a seperate API to generate audio.  The API call will likely take 1-2 minutes in the first version of the MVP.  
//In future updates of this product, we will utilize anticipated improvements in the server capacity, processing speed to execute the processing of video responses in increasingly shorter time spans. 
//Once the video has been generated, the backend will combine the video and audio. The video and audio will be updated on the UX.   
// This produces the user experience of speaking to a screen that speaks back to you with a video.   
// A case example of this application is for people who wish to improve their communication skills. 
// In such an example, the description of the video generated in the backend might be 
"Produce a friendly avatar of a teacher saying "Great eye contact!  
Something that would improve your communication even more is to allow your voice to project from your diaphrahm a bit more. 
This will enable you to sound even more confident.  Great job on the content of your speech. 
You're using the right tense of the verbs.  Let's continue our diologue.  
Tell me more about the market trends you mentioned earlier in your elevator pitch! 
And feel free to take a moment to formulate your response.  
A short pause here and there during a stressful conversation like this can help you auto-regulate your breathing which will 
//  both help you be more calm and demonstrate that you are comfortable with displaying you are willing to actively listen to
//what the person said before giving your response."
// As servers become more powerful, we will update our models to facilitate higher quality video generated in time intervals that eventually get as close as possible to real time video that's updated many times per second, producing an almost "real time" simulation experience.  
// In the first several MVPs, we'll build this product in such a way that does not attempt to generate human-like faces or bodies.  
//This will eliminate the ackward and often off-putting experience of near-life-like figures appearing in videos and images produced by AI.
// It is conceivable that one day, our confidience, determined by success rate, of life-like video generation in real time is so high 
that we may choose to turn on the ability for users to request simulated real time videos that
resemble life-like faces and people.  If this ever does become feasible, the usefulness of this 
application will be even more exceptional for the application of rapid learning and
gaining comfortability with learning experiences that are difficult, impractically expensive, risky, or 
intimidating to practice in real life (such as practicing a job interview or 
ordering Spanish food in Spain as a non-native aspiring polyglot).  Other applications would 
include using this for instances of exposure therapy where people subject themselves to increasingly more
immersive encounters with fears (public speaking, being near open water/swimming, fear of heights, just to name a couple) they want to overcome.

//This example uses javascript functions for simulations and updating the scrolling banner. 
//We need to replace the placeholder functions ('generateSimulation', updateScrollingBanner,etc.') with our actual AI, ML, and LLMs code.  
//We also need to set up a backend server to handle the processing and communication with our models, we'll discuss in a later group chat
// This is a basic structure and we will expand or modify it to fit requirements according to our user feedback. i.e. remove features they don't want, and improve popular features.
